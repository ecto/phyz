# phyz

> Open-source differentiable multi-physics simulation engine. Pure Rust. GPU-accelerated. Analytical gradients for optimization, control, and learning.

## Overview

phyz gives you analytical derivatives through physics simulation for free. Simulate a robot, compute gradients through the entire trajectory, and optimize a controller — in one loop. No finite differencing needed.

## Features

- Rigid Bodies: Featherstone ABA, O(n) forward dynamics, articulated joints
- Differentiable: Analytical Jacobians at every timestep for optimization, control, and learning
- Particles: SPH fluids, granular media, molecular dynamics
- Electromagnetism: Maxwell's equations on Yee lattice
- General Relativity: Regge calculus with Einstein-Maxwell action
- Probabilistic: SVGD, HMC for Bayesian inference over physics
- MJCF Loading: Import MuJoCo XML models directly
- GPU Batching: WGPU compute for thousands of parallel environments
- Kernel Compiler: Fuse physics ops into optimized GPU kernels
- Multi-physics Coupling: Compose rigid bodies, particles, EM fields in one simulation
- Real2Sim: Inverse problems, parameter fitting from observations
