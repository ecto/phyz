Excellent! Phase 13 is complete. Let me create a summary of what was implemented:

## Phase 13: Self-Correcting Simulation - Complete ✅

I've successfully implemented Phase 13, which adds adaptive time-stepping, conservation monitoring, and graceful degradation to the tau physics engine.

### What Was Implemented

**New Crate: `tau-guardian`**

#### 1. **Conservation Monitoring** (`conservation.rs`)
- `ConservationMonitor`: Tracks energy, momentum, and angular momentum errors
- `ConservationState`: Baseline conservation quantities for drift detection
- Functions to compute total momentum and angular momentum
- Tests validating energy and momentum conservation

#### 2. **Adaptive Time-Stepping** (`time_step.rs`)
- `PiController`: PI controller for automatic dt adjustment based on error
- `EmbeddedRkError`: Error estimation using RK4 vs RK5 comparison (Cash-Karp)
- `AdaptiveTimeStep`: Manager combining error estimation with PI control
- Automatically increases/decreases timestep to maintain accuracy
- Tests for controller behavior and clamping

#### 3. **Graceful Degradation** (`degradation.rs`)
- `SolverQuality`: Five quality levels (Excellent, Good, Marginal, Poor, Critical)
- `DegradationStrategy`: Adaptive responses based on quality assessment
- `AutoSwitchController`: Automatically switches solvers when quality degrades
- `SolverSuggestion`: Recommendations for solver changes
- Tests for quality assessment and auto-switching

#### 4. **Multi-Rate Integration** (`multi_rate.rs`)
- `RRespaIntegrator`: r-RESPA implementation for different force timescales
- Force splitting utilities for separating slow/fast forces
- Allows fast forces (stiff springs) at small dt_inner
- Slow forces (gravity) at large dt_outer for efficiency
- Tests validating timestep ratios and stepping

### Examples

1. **`adaptive_pendulum.rs`**: Demonstrates PI controller adjusting dt dynamically
2. **`conservation_monitor.rs`**: Tracks conservation laws in chaotic double pendulum
3. **`multi_rate.rs`**: Shows efficiency gains from r-RESPA force splitting

### Key Features

- **Automatic dt adaptation**: PI controller with configurable tolerance
- **Conservation tracking**: Energy, linear momentum, angular momentum
- **Quality assessment**: 5-level grading system based on error ratios
- **Graceful degradation**: Reduce dt or switch solvers when accuracy drops
- **Multi-rate efficiency**: Evaluate slow forces less frequently than fast forces
- **Shadow Hamiltonian ready**: Infrastructure for symplectic integrator monitoring

### Verification

✅ All tests pass (10 new tests)  
✅ Clippy clean with `-D warnings`  
✅ Properly formatted  
✅ Integrated into workspace  
✅ Examples compile and demonstrate functionality

The implementation follows the specification exactly, providing robust simulation health monitoring and adaptive control that will be essential for long-running simulations and complex multi-physics scenarios.
