Excellent! Phase 5 is complete. Let me create a quick summary:

## Phase 5: Particle Physics (MPM) - Complete

I've successfully implemented the Material Point Method (MPM) solver for tau, adding particle physics capabilities to the engine. Here's what was implemented:

### Core Components

**1. tau-particle crate** with three main modules:
   - **material.rs**: Constitutive models for elastic, plastic, granular, and fluid materials
   - **particle.rs**: Particle state representation with position, velocity, mass, deformation gradient
   - **mpm.rs**: Complete MPM solver with P2G/G2P transfer using APIC

### Key Features

- **Constitutive Models**:
  - Neo-Hookean elastic (with safe matrix inversion)
  - Elastic-plastic with von Mises yield criterion
  - Drucker-Prager granular material with friction angle
  - Fluid with equation of state (ideal gas and water-like)

- **MPM Algorithm**:
  - Cubic B-spline weight functions for smooth interpolation
  - P2G (Particle-to-Grid) transfer of mass, momentum, and stress
  - Grid-based force computation with gravity
  - G2P (Grid-to-Particle) transfer with PIC/FLIP blending
  - Boundary conditions for domain walls
  - APIC affine velocity field for reduced dissipation

### Examples

Created three demonstration programs:
1. **granular_column.rs**: 40,000 particle column collapse simulation
2. **water_container.rs**: Fluid filling container with EOS
3. **sphere_in_sand.rs**: Rigid sphere falling into sand (particle-based coupling concept)

### Tests

All 8 unit tests pass:
- Material stress computation (elastic, fluid)
- Weight function correctness
- Mass conservation
- Free fall dynamics
- Momentum conservation (horizontal and vertical with gravity)

### Verification

✅ All workspace tests pass (38 tests total)  
✅ Clippy passes with no warnings  
✅ Code formatted with rustfmt  
✅ Commit created: `phase 5: particle physics (mpm)`

The implementation provides a solid foundation for particle-based simulations and sets the stage for future phases involving fluid dynamics, multi-physics coupling, and advanced material models.
