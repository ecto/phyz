Excellent! Both examples run successfully. Let me create a summary of what was implemented:

## Phase 2: Multi-joint + MJCF - Implementation Complete

I've successfully implemented Phase 2 of the tau physics engine. Here's what was accomplished:

### ✅ Core Features Implemented

1. **Extended Joint Type System**
   - Added support for all standard joint types:
     - `Revolute`/`Hinge` (1 DOF rotation)
     - `Prismatic`/`Slide` (1 DOF translation)
     - `Spherical`/`Ball` (3 DOF rotation via quaternions)
     - `Free` (6 DOF: 3 translation + 3 rotation)
     - `Fixed` (0 DOF rigid attachment)

2. **Quaternion Math Utilities** (`tau-math/quaternion.rs`)
   - Full quaternion implementation with exp/log maps
   - Conversion to/from rotation matrices
   - Properly handles axis-angle representation for integration
   - All tests pass including roundtrip conversions

3. **Joint Transform & Motion Subspace**
   - Implemented `joint_transform_slice()` for multi-DOF joints
   - Implemented `motion_subspace_matrix()` returning 6×ndof matrices
   - Backward compatible `joint_transform()` and `motion_subspace()` for single-DOF
   - Fixed joints properly handled with zero DOF

4. **MJCF Parser** (new `tau-mjcf` crate)
   - Parses MuJoCo MJCF XML format
   - Supports body hierarchy, joints, inertia, and options
   - Converts MJCF models to tau `Model`
   - Includes defaults system for attribute inheritance

5. **Updated ModelBuilder**
   - Added constructors for all joint types
   - Generic `add_body()` method for custom configurations

### ✅ Examples & Testing

- **multi_joint.rs**: 2-link arm with revolute + prismatic joints (demonstrates mixed joint types)
- **ant.rs**: Quadruped robot loaded from MJCF with 8 revolute joints + 1 fixed joint
- **MJCF models**: `simple_arm.xml` and `ant.xml` test files

### ✅ Verification

All tests pass:
- 20 unit tests across all crates
- Zero clippy warnings
- Code properly formatted
- Both examples run successfully with correct physics

### 📝 Notes

- Multi-DOF joint support is infrastructure-only at this stage
- ABA/RNEA/CRBA currently work with single-DOF and fixed joints
- Full multi-DOF integration for spherical/free joints will be added in a future phase
- Quaternion integration prepared for future spherical joint dynamics

The implementation is complete and ready for Phase 3!
