Perfect! Phase 11 is complete. Let me create a brief summary of what was implemented:

## Phase 11: Multi-Scale Coupling - Implementation Complete

I've successfully implemented Phase 11, creating a new `tau-coupling` crate that provides infrastructure for coupling different physics solvers together. Here's what was built:

### Core Components

**1. Spatial Coupling (`boundary.rs`)**
- `BoundingBox`: Axis-aligned bounding boxes for defining overlap regions
- Spatial queries: containment, overlap, intersection, volume calculations

**2. Solver Coupling (`coupling.rs`)**
- `SolverType`: Enum of physics solvers (RigidBody, Particle, EM, MD, QFT, LBM)
- `ForceTransfer`: Three coupling mechanisms:
  - Direct damping: `F = -k(v_a - v_b)`
  - Momentum flux: rate-based transfer
  - Barrier potential: spring-like forces
- `Coupling`: Defines handshake regions between solver pairs

**3. Electromagnetic Coupling (`lorentz.rs`)**
- Lorentz force: `F = q(E + v × B)`
- Magnetic torque: `τ = μ × B`
- Electric dipole force in non-uniform fields
- Radiation pressure from EM fields

**4. Subcycling (`subcycling.rs`)**
- `TimeScale`: Classification (UltraFast, Fast, Medium, Slow, VerySlow)
- `SubcyclingSchedule`: Multi-timescale integration with configurable ratios
- r-RESPA partitioning: fast/slow force separation

### Examples

1. **lorentz_pendulum.rs**: EM→rigid coupling with oscillating fields driving a charged pendulum
2. **subcycling.rs**: Demonstrates multi-timescale stepping patterns
3. **multi_solver.rs**: Complete example of rigid body + particle coupling with momentum conservation

### Test Coverage

- 23 unit tests covering all functionality
- Verified energy/momentum conservation across couplings
- Newton's 3rd law enforcement in force transfer
- All tests passing ✓

The implementation provides a clean, extensible foundation for multi-physics simulation with proper conservation laws and flexible coupling strategies.
