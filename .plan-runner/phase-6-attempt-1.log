Excellent! Phase 6 is now complete. Let me summarize what was implemented:

## Phase 6: Python + vcad Integration - Summary

I successfully implemented PyO3 bindings for the tau physics engine with the following components:

### ✅ Completed Features

1. **tau-py Crate** (`crates/tau-py/`):
   - PyO3 0.28 bindings with Python 3.14 support
   - Proper workspace configuration (opted out with empty `[workspace]`)
   - Maturin build system configured

2. **Python API**:
   - `Model` and `ModelBuilder` classes with builder pattern
   - `State` class with NumPy array properties (q, v, ctrl, time)
   - `Simulator` class with step(), step_with_jacobians(), and simulate()
   - `MjcfLoader` for loading models from XML files
   - `StepJacobians` for accessing differentiation results as NumPy arrays

3. **NumPy Interoperability**:
   - State arrays (q, v, ctrl) exposed as NumPy arrays
   - Jacobian matrices returned as NumPy 2D arrays
   - Zero-copy access via PyArray bindings

4. **Examples**:
   - `example_basic.py` - Basic pendulum simulation
   - `example_jacobians.py` - Computing and displaying Jacobians
   - `example_jax.py` - JAX compatibility demonstration

5. **Gymnasium Environment**:
   - `TauEnv` base class compatible with Gym API
   - `AntEnv` example environment with reward computation
   - Support for reset(), step(), observation/action spaces

6. **Tests**:
   - 8 passing tests in `test_basic.py` covering:
     - Version string
     - Model builder
     - State creation and modification
     - Simulator stepping (Euler and RK4)
     - Jacobian computation
   - Placeholder tests for MJCF loading and Gym environments

### Key Design Decisions

1. **PyO3 0.28**: Upgraded from 0.22 to support Python 3.14
2. **Unsendable Simulator**: Marked `PySimulator` as `unsendable` since `Solver` trait doesn't implement `Send + Sync`
3. **Builder Pattern**: Used `std::mem::replace` to work around `ModelBuilder` not implementing `Clone`
4. **API Compatibility**: Followed Rust naming conventions while maintaining Pythonic interface

### Verification

All checks passed:
- ✅ `maturin develop` builds successfully
- ✅ `python -c "import tau; print(tau.__version__)"` returns "0.1.0"
- ✅ `cargo test --workspace` - all tests pass
- ✅ `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` - no warnings
- ✅ `cargo fmt --all --check` - properly formatted
- ✅ Python tests pass with pytest

The implementation provides a solid foundation for using tau from Python with NumPy/JAX interoperability and Gymnasium compatibility!
