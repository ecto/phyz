## Phase 8: Electromagnetic Field Simulation (FDTD) - Complete ✓

I've successfully implemented the FDTD (Finite-Difference Time-Domain) electromagnetic field solver with the following components:

### Created `tau-em` crate with:

1. **YeeGrid Structure** (`grid.rs`):
   - 3D array storage for electric (E) and magnetic (H) fields
   - Staggered Yee grid with E-fields at edges and H-fields at faces
   - Material properties (permittivity, permeability, conductivity)
   - Energy computation and spatial indexing

2. **FDTD Update Equations** (`fdtd.rs`):
   - Maxwell's curl equations discretized on Yee grid
   - `update_h_field()`: H-field update using ∇ × E
   - `update_e_field()`: E-field update using ∇ × H with conductivity loss
   - CFL stability checking (dt/dx ≤ 1/√3)

3. **Boundary Conditions** (`boundary.rs`):
   - **PML (Perfectly Matched Layer)**: Absorbing boundaries with polynomial grading
   - **Periodic**: Wrapping boundary conditions
   - **PEC (Perfect Electric Conductor)**: Zero tangential E-field

4. **Electromagnetic Sources** (`source.rs`):
   - **PointDipole**: Oscillating electric dipole source
   - **PlaneWave**: Propagating plane wave
   - **CurrentLoop**: Magnetic dipole (current loop)
   - **Probe**: Field measurement at specific points with time-series recording

5. **FdtdSolver** (`solver.rs`):
   - High-level simulation interface
   - Multi-source support
   - Field probes for time-series measurements
   - Observable computations:
     - Total electromagnetic energy
     - Poynting flux through surfaces
     - Field values at probe points

### Comprehensive Test Suite:
- ✓ Energy conservation tests
- ✓ CFL stability verification
- ✓ PEC reflection tests
- ✓ PML boundary absorption
- ✓ Source injection tests
- ✓ Poynting flux computation
- ✓ Plane wave propagation

All tests pass, clippy warnings resolved, and code properly formatted. The commit has been created following the project conventions.
