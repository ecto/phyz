Perfect! The example runs successfully and demonstrates the probabilistic simulation with parameter uncertainty. 

## Summary

I have successfully implemented **Phase 16: Probabilistic Simulation** for the tau physics engine. Here's what was created:

### New Crate: `tau-prob`
Located in `crates/tau-prob/`, this crate provides:

1. **`distribution.rs`** - Distribution representation using weighted particle ensembles:
   - Uniform and weighted distributions
   - Weighted mean and covariance computation
   - Effective sample size calculation
   - Systematic resampling for particle filters

2. **`state.rs`** - Probabilistic state with uncertain parameters:
   - `ProbabilisticState` wrapping distributions over q, v, and physical parameters
   - Methods to create uniform or perturbed samples
   - Parameter sampling with custom distributions
   - Mean and standard deviation computation

3. **`ensemble.rs`** - Ensemble simulation and uncertainty propagation:
   - `EnsembleSolver` trait for stepping simulations
   - `ensemble_step` and `ensemble_step_with_params` for batch simulation
   - `trajectory_uncertainty` for computing mean ± std over time
   - Tests validating ensemble dynamics

4. **`svgd.rs`** - Stein Variational Gradient Descent for parameter inference:
   - RBF kernel with median bandwidth heuristic
   - SVGD update steps for particle optimization
   - Inference functions for parameter estimation from observations
   - Tests validating kernel functions and SVGD convergence

### Example: `ensemble_pendulum.rs`
Demonstrates:
- Creating probabilistic state with perturbed initial conditions
- Sampling uncertain physical parameters (length, mass, damping)
- Ensemble simulation with 100 particles
- Tracking mean ± std trajectories over time
- Observation that uncertainty propagates and ESS remains stable

### Key Features
- ✅ All 14 tests pass
- ✅ Clippy warnings resolved (including pre-existing tau-wasm issues)
- ✅ Code properly formatted
- ✅ Example runs successfully showing uncertainty propagation
- ✅ Integrated into workspace and main tau crate

The implementation follows the specification exactly, providing distribution-wrapped states, ensemble simulation, resampling, and SVGD for parameter inference. The probabilistic framework is ready for uncertainty quantification, inverse problems, and randomized algorithms.
