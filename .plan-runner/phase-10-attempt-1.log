Excellent! Phase 10 has been successfully implemented. Let me provide a summary:

## Phase 10: Lattice Gauge Theory (QFT) - Implementation Complete ✓

I've successfully implemented a lattice gauge theory simulation system with Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling. Here's what was created:

### New Crate: `tau-qft`

**Core Components:**

1. **`group.rs`** - Gauge group implementations:
   - **U(1)**: Complex phase e^(iθ) with angle-based operations
   - **SU(2)**: Unit quaternion representation for 2×2 unitary matrices
   - **SU(3)**: 3×3 complex matrix representation for QCD
   - Group trait with operations: multiplication, inverse, trace, force computation, and momentum sampling

2. **`lattice.rs`** - 4D spacetime lattice structure:
   - Link variables U_μ(n) connecting sites in 4 directions
   - Periodic boundary conditions
   - Plaquette computation (Wilson loops)
   - Staple sum for force calculation
   - Wilson action: S = β Σ (1 - Re Tr U_plaq)

3. **`hmc.rs`** - Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm:
   - Leapfrog integrator for molecular dynamics
   - Hamiltonian H = kinetic + potential energy
   - Metropolis accept/reject step
   - Momentum sampling from Gaussian distribution
   - HMC state tracking (acceptance rate, Hamiltonian drift)

4. **`observables.rs`** - Physical measurements:
   - Average plaquette ⟨Re Tr U_plaq⟩
   - Wilson loops W(R,T) for confinement studies
   - Polyakov loops for deconfinement phase transitions
   - Autocorrelation functions and integrated autocorrelation time

### Examples:

1. **`phase_transition.rs`**: Scans coupling β to observe order-disorder transition in U(1) gauge theory
2. **`wilson_loops.rs`**: Measures Wilson loops of various sizes to extract string tension

### Key Features:

- ✅ Full U(1), SU(2), and SU(3) group support
- ✅ 4D lattice with periodic boundaries
- ✅ Hybrid Monte Carlo with leapfrog integration
- ✅ Force computation via staples
- ✅ Physical observables (plaquettes, Wilson loops, Polyakov loops)
- ✅ Statistical analysis tools (autocorrelation)
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (13 tests passing)
- ✅ Clean Rust 2024 edition compliance
- ✅ No clippy warnings
- ✅ Properly formatted code

All tests pass, and the implementation follows the existing tau codebase patterns. The system is ready for lattice QCD simulations and phase transition studies.
