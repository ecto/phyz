Perfect! Let me create a brief summary of what was implemented:

## Phase 14: Emergent Physics - Implementation Complete ✓

I've successfully implemented Phase 14: Emergent Physics for the tau simulation engine. Here's what was added:

### New Crate: `tau-lbm`

**Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) Solvers:**
1. **D2Q9** (2D nine-velocity lattice) - `d2q9.rs`
   - BGK collision operator
   - Periodic streaming with bounce-back boundary conditions
   - Density and velocity computation
   - Energy conservation tracking

2. **D3Q19** (3D 19-velocity lattice) - `d3q19.rs`
   - Full 3D incompressible flow solver
   - Same features as D2Q9 but for 3D domains

**Equation-Free Simulation Framework** - `equation_free.rs`
- `FineSolver` trait for microscopic dynamics
- `CoarseProjector` trait for lift/restrict operations
- `EquationFreeWrapper` for coarse projective integration
- `SpatialAverageProjector` implementation
- `effective_information()` function using PCA to measure emergence

### Examples

1. **`lbm_cavity.rs`** - Lid-driven cavity flow
   - Classic CFD benchmark demonstrating Navier-Stokes recovery
   - Vortex detection and velocity profile analysis

2. **`equation_free_demo.rs`** - Multi-scale simulation
   - Reaction-diffusion fine solver
   - Demonstrates lift/restrict/extrapolate cycle
   - Emergence detection via effective information

### Tests

All 8 tests passing:
- Equilibrium distribution verification
- Density conservation (mass conservation)
- Viscous dissipation (energy decay in shear flow)
- Spatial averaging accuracy
- Equation-free wrapper correctness
- PCA-based effective information measure

The implementation recovers macroscopic Navier-Stokes equations from microscopic LBM dynamics, demonstrating emergent fluid behavior and providing a framework for multi-scale physics without explicit macroscopic equations.
