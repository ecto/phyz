Perfect! Phase 3 is complete. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Phase 3: Collision + Contacts - Complete ✅

### Implemented Features

**tau-collision crate:**
- **GJK Algorithm**: Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi algorithm for computing signed distance between convex shapes
- **EPA Algorithm**: Expanding Polytope Algorithm for accurate penetration depth calculation
- **Broad-phase**: Sweep-and-prune algorithm for efficient collision pair detection using AABBs
- **Geometry Support**: Sphere, Box, Capsule, Cylinder, Mesh (convex), and Plane primitives
- **Support Functions**: Efficient support point calculation for each geometry type

**tau-contact crate:**
- **Soft Contact Model**: MuJoCo-style penalty-based contact forces
- **Contact Materials**: Configurable stiffness, damping, friction, and bounce parameters
- **Ground Contacts**: Specialized detection for ground plane interactions
- **Contact Forces**: Penalty force computation from penetration depth

**Model Extensions:**
- Added `Geometry` enum to `Body` struct for collision shapes
- Extended `ModelBuilder` to support geometry assignment
- Added helper methods to `SpatialTransform` for accessing translation and rotation

**Example:**
- `ball_drop.rs`: Simple particle simulation demonstrating bouncing behavior with ground contact

### Tests & Verification
- ✅ All workspace tests pass (27 tests total)
- ✅ Clippy clean (no warnings)
- ✅ Code formatted
- ✅ Git commit created

The collision detection system is now integrated and ready for use in more complex simulations!
