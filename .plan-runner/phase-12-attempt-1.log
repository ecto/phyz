Perfect! Let me create a quick summary of what was implemented:

## Phase 12: Gravity - Complete ✅

I've successfully implemented a layered gravity solver with 5 levels of sophistication, from constant uniform gravity to post-Newtonian corrections for general relativity effects.

### What was implemented:

**New crate: `tau-gravity`**

1. **Layer 1: Constant Gravity** (`constant.rs`)
   - Uniform gravitational field (e.g., Earth's g = 9.81 m/s²)
   - Simple force computation: F = m·g
   - Potential energy calculation

2. **Layer 2: Poisson Solver** (`poisson.rs`)
   - Density-dependent gravity via Poisson equation: ∇²Φ = 4πGρ
   - Jacobi iteration on 3D grid
   - Cloud-in-cell particle density deposition
   - Force computation via gradient: g = -∇Φ

3. **Layer 3: N-body Solver** (`nbody.rs`)
   - Direct pairwise O(N²) gravitational forces with softening
   - Barnes-Hut octree structure for O(N log N) approximation
   - Hierarchical center-of-mass computation
   - Opening angle criterion (θ parameter)

4. **Layer 4: Post-Newtonian Corrections** (`pn.rs`)
   - **1PN**: First post-Newtonian relativistic corrections (v²/c² order)
     - Perihelion precession (Mercury: 43.1 arcsec/century)
     - Schwarzschild-like terms
   - **2.5PN**: Gravitational radiation damping (v⁵/c⁵ order)
     - Radiative energy loss
     - Binary orbital decay
   - Orbital element computation (a, e, i, Ω, ω, ν)
   - Perihelion precession rate calculator

5. **Supporting infrastructure**:
   - `GravityParticle`: Position, velocity, force, mass
   - `GravitySolver` trait: Unified interface for all gravity layers
   - Physical constants: G, C, G_EARTH

### Tests:
- ✅ 14 unit tests covering all solver types
- ✅ 9 integration tests including:
  - Free fall under constant gravity
  - N-body energy conservation
  - Mercury perihelion precession calculation (43.1 arcsec/century)
  - Orbital element extraction
  - PN vs Newtonian comparison
  - 2.5PN radiation reaction
- ✅ All doctests passing

### Example:
Created `examples/mercury_precession.rs` demonstrating Mercury's famous 43 arcsec/century perihelion precession using 1PN corrections.

All tests pass, clippy warnings resolved, code formatted, and committed!
