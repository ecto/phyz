Perfect! Phase 7 has been successfully implemented. Let me summarize what was completed:

## Phase 7: World Generation + Training - Complete ✓

### Implemented Features:

#### 1. **tau-world Crate** - New module for procedural generation and ML training
   - **WorldGenerator**: Seeded procedural generation with multiple methods:
     - `random_chain()`: Generate n-link kinematic chains with randomized masses/lengths
     - `random_quadruped()`: Create 9-body quadruped robot (torso + 4 legs)
     - `platform_with_obstacles()`: Fixed platform with random obstacles
     - `random_tree()`: Branching kinematic tree structure

#### 2. **Sensor Models**
   - **Sensor types**: JointState, BodyAccel, BodyAngularVel, ForceTorque, Rangefinder, IMU, FrameCapture
   - **SensorOutput**: Timestamped flattened sensor readings
   - Integration into simulation loop for automatic data collection

#### 3. **Tendon Model**
   - Cable-like actuators spanning multiple bodies
   - Spring-damper dynamics with force saturation
   - Path-based force distribution across body chains

#### 4. **World Container**
   - Combines Model + State + Sensors + Tendons + History
   - Automatic sensor recording during simulation steps
   - Callback-based step function (avoids circular dependencies)

#### 5. **TrajectoryRecorder**
   - Records (q, v, ctrl, time) trajectories for ML training
   - Export to JSON format
   - Flat dictionary format for numpy/ML frameworks
   - Trajectory statistics (nsteps, nq, nv, duration)

#### 6. **WASM Support**
   - Updated tau-wasm with world generation and training APIs
   - `WasmWorldGenerator` for browser-based world creation
   - `WasmTrajectoryRecorder` for trajectory export
   - `WasmSimulator` with sensor integration

#### 7. **Examples**
   - `world_generation.rs`: Demonstrates all procedural generation methods
   - `training_data.rs`: Shows sensor recording and trajectory export
   - `tendon_demo.rs`: Demonstrates tendon actuators and force computation

### Test Results:
- ✅ All workspace tests pass (61 tests)
- ✅ Clippy clean (no warnings)
- ✅ Code formatted correctly
- ✅ Git commit created: "phase 7: world generation + training"

The implementation successfully adds procedural world generation, sensor models, tendons, and ML training data export capabilities to the tau physics engine, completing Phase 7 as specified.
